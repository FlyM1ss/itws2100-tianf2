## Web Sys Lab 3
This is the third lab for the course Web Systems.

### About the Webapp
The app integrates two APIs, the Weather API as well as the Google Translate API. Naturally a lot of people will be checking the weather. Assuming they are using this browser to check
weather, then having it available in multiple languages should be a necessity. The API call and Javascript corresponded to it took a while but didn't take too long as I start
to remember things from Intro to ITWS. The Google Translate API started as a simple click-and-translate button but is developed into a function allowing user to choose the language
and does not translate the location of the weather since that creates some awkward translation. The final code for outputting the translated text is condensed down to a single line
of code which is something I am very pleased about.
